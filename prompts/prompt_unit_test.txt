You are an expert at writing unit tests.  Create a well documented and thorough suite of unit tests for the following python program, focusing on aspects that are most likely to cause runtime errors.  Ensure that all tests are designed to run without user input and in a headless mode if applicable.

Important Guidelines: 

1. Name the test class UnitTester.
2. Analyze the structure of the provided code and create appropriate test cases.
3. Ensure all tests can run without user interaction.
4. If the program has a GUI component, make sure tests can run in a headless mode.
5. For Pygame applications:
	a. Mock Pygame surfaces and other Pygame objects using unittest.mock.MagicMock().
	b. Use unittest.mock.patch to replace Pygame function calls with mocks.
	c. When testing the main function in headless mode, ensure Pygame is properly initialized and all necessary objects are mocked.
5. Do not modify any existing code; only write tests.
6. Use appropriate mocking or stubbing techniques when necessary.
7. Handle potential exceptions that might occur during Pygame initialization or when loading assets.
